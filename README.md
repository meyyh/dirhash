# termimg
this is a project where i try to draw images in terminal in various different languages focusing on speed, cross platform, lightweight, low dependencies etc depending on what I feel like doing

# goals 
at some point I want to have multiple versions of the same language with all of them having a version that supports

- png, jpg, webp, gif, mp4, mov, mkv, webm
- support urls as inputs
- different modes
  - fill - strech to fill entire terminal
  - fit that makes it as tall as the terminal but saves aspect ratio
  - invert/change colors
- works on windows and linux excluding platform specific "languages" like cmd and bash
-upload best version to things like winget and aur
-make documentaion on how some of this even works as i still dont fully understand it
